# Use this file to easily define all of your cron jobs.
#
# It's helpful, but not entirely necessary to understand cron syntax (5 fields):
#
# minute (0 - 59)
# hour (0 - 23)
# day of month (1 - 31)
# month (1 - 12)
# day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday = 0 or 7)

#
# set :output, "/path/to/my/cron_log.log"
#
# every 2.hours do
#   command "/usr/bin/some_great_command"
#   runner "MyModel.some_method"
#   rake "some:great:rake:task"
# end
#
# every 4.days do
#   runner "AnotherModel.prune_old_records"
# end
